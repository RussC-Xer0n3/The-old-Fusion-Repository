# Fusion?
## Investigating helictical equilateral infinite loops

### Is it really fusion?
Yes and No. Let's imagine what is happening in real life fusion, the sun for example is producing and burning hydrogen amongst other gasses. As such the sun is self-reinforcing it's size (almost) and it's existence by producing what it consumes to stay hot and volatile.

### So what's the project about if it isn't fusion?
Glad you asked, I simply called the project fusion for several reasosns

- The end goal was to create a self-reinforcing helictical equilateral infinite loop which is both balanced and logical
- As I wrote the code I imagined what the sun might be doing mathematically
- I broke the rules of coding standards and used an infinite loop which has some surprising effects on a piece of hardware

### What happened?
Something weird happened on my old [Sony Xperia G331](https://www.sony.com/). I was using [AIDE Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui&gl=US) (because everone who is anyone in dev world knows [AIDE App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui&gl=US) is awesome) and left the code running without the signals blasting out everywhere (safety first) and what could best be described as a logical display occurred. That lead me to believe I had managed to create a piece of code which is both logically and spherically sound, equillibrious if you prefer.

### What next?
Well that really is as far as I wanted to take the project, I acheived hat i set out to acheive, initially prioviked by [the russian wedding rings](https://russc-xer0n3.github.io/The-Russian-Wedding-Rings) and spurred on by the sun and how it's convection currents might work, I got my answer. There are a few warnings in the README.md file of the repository I suggest you read first as a few tests were performed, including a networked running at the epicentre of Lacey's in Weymouth where I was staying a while ago, back in 2019. It was run whilst I was networked via the TV which was connected to the scart and via ethernet (Had to very quickly pull the plug when I realised the stupidity). EEEEEP!
