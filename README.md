Been a while since I have had some phone and login isuses. Yay! not.

# Fusion---potentially
Theorising on fusion in applied mathmatics in programming - i have to imagine this and add control vectors.
I say do not use that code, it is more, please don't apply it unless it is tested and complete theoretically first. stay safe
3.1.1

I plan to initially gather as much information as possible surrounding this piece of code. Fully consider any health risks depending on real world application and as such this may take quite some time. Iwrite not to use this code even though it is in the public domain because of potential health risks to others given that I or other professionals have not yet looked intot he effects of it, at least I don't think so anyway. 

I plan to gather data on it's behaviour and attempt or at least find a way of representing it's functionality visually both for continued research and to assess it's behaviour.

I will be writing up on this in due course and am in consideration of an academic approach initially following some liason with various academic and professional academies.

Following the write up which will include any potential applications, confirmed safe applications and potentially applications to avoid in the conclusive statements.

Tests will and should definitely be performed in the correct manner following all health and safety guidelines of those areas of specialism to as best possible fully mitigate any risk to organic, economic and security based matter and systems respectively.

The intent is to find productive uses which will benefit aforementioned matter and systems for the better and not worse.

The algorithm just needs stabilising inside a restrictive for loop in computing. Gravity might be a good force to use or electromagnetic radiation within the normal safety bounds laid out by ofcom, iso and keeping in mind the IEEE standardisations.

One of these algo's was actually cooling down my phone processors, though there may have been some remote interaction. As such they do need testing again offline. I had all the signals blaring out, Bluetooth, WiFi, gsm, gprs and NFC at the time oh and 'nearby' was on.
